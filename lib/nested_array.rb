def assembled_matrix
  # Build an array that contains both of the above arrays
  # This matrix will represent a produce storage room
  # Organic standards require that organic products be stored ABOVE conventional, not the other way around
  # Make sure conventional produce is first, on the 'zeroth' / 'bottom' shelf

  # Using Array literal syntax only, build another nested array that 
  # uses the arrays of conventional and organic produce as before.
  # However, this time, sort each internal array alphabetically by the first character
